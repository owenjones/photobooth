# Photobooth
A (crappy) lightweight photobooth, written in Python. Originally created for the "Witan in a Weekend" SSAGO Rally in February 2018 (#biggestrallyever), and re-birthed for Roman Rally in February 2020.

## Requirements
* Raspberry Pi, with PiCamera
* TV/monitor that supports 1080p (surely they all do now)
* Hardware button, triggering pin 6 (although that can be changed)
